# 🤖 MLOps & LLM Engineering

Covers the complete lifecycle from data ingestion and model training to deployment, monitoring, and optimization - with focus on reliability and scalability.

## 🔄 Data Pipelines & Orchestration

- 🏭 **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Cloud-based data integration service for creating, scheduling, and orchestrating data pipelines. Essential for ETL/ELT processes, data movement, and transformation workflows in ML/AI projects.

## 🧱 Serving & Inference

- 🔌 [LiteLLM sample](https://github.com/ngnlx/litellm-sample): lightweight gateway/proxy using the OpenAI-compatible API in front of multiple models/providers (ChatGPT/OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock/Claude, …). This sample is currently configured to run with Azure AI Foundry. Ideal for quick POCs, local dev, cost-aware routing, and swapping models with minimal (or zero) code changes.
