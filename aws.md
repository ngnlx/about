# ☁️ AWS Experience

Building automated AWS environments and Kubernetes clusters with Terraform/Terragrunt and CloudFormation.

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Automation
- 🏗️ **Provision AWS infrastructure with Terraform and CodeDeploy** – [ngnlx/provision-aws-infrastructure-using-terraform](https://github.com/ngnlx/provision-aws-infrastructure-using-terraform).
- ⚙️ **Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform with GitHub Actions** – [ngnlx/provision-infra-in-aws-with-github-actions](https://github.com/ngnlx/provision-infra-in-aws-with-github-actions).

## 🐳 Kubernetes & Deployment

- 🐋 **Standard AWS architecture with Terraform (EKS)** **🆕 Newly Updated - Must Read** [View detailed project documentation](aws/eks-project.md)
  - Maintained and enhanced AWS infrastructure for production microservices, focusing on stability, scalability, and security.
  - Standardized IaC with Terraform & Terragrunt for EKS clusters, VPC, EC2 ASG, RDS, S3, and IAM.
  - Containerized apps with Docker and deployed to EKS using Helm charts for consistent environments.
  - Built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, automating build, test, and deployment across all stages.
  - Implemented centralized monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and CloudWatch.
  - Enforced security best practices using AWS Config, GuardDuty, Security Hub, and Trivy.

- 🚀 **Deploy to EKS with ArgoCD & GitHub Actions** – [ngnlx/eks-deployment-with-argocd](https://github.com/ngnlx/eks-deployment-with-argocd).

## 📦 CloudFormation

- 📯 **Load balancer with Auto Scaling using CloudFormation** – [ngnlx/load-balancer-with-asg-using-cloudformation](https://github.com/ngnlx/load-balancer-with-asg-using-cloudformation).
