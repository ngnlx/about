# 🚀 Cloud Engineer Portfolio

Hi there! I'm **Nguyen**, a Cloud/DevOps Engineer with 13+ years in software development and over 6 years specializing in Azure, AWS, and Kubernetes. I’ve worked with product teams across Australia, Europe, and the US, spanning multiple programming languages, architectures, and enterprise environments.

Thanks to that broad exposure, I can onboard into new projects quickly without facing technical or communication barriers. I understand how teams operate, how systems evolve, and how to support developers effectively from day one.

While my focus today is Cloud, DevOps, and Platform Engineering, I also contribute to architecture design, solution evaluation, and early technical decision-making. I work closely with network and security teams to understand their requirements and constraints, ensuring that the platforms and solutions we build are secure, scalable, maintainable, and deployment-ready from the start.

## 🎯 What I Bring to the Table

***A. Technical Breadth & Cross-Disciplinary Capability***

**1. Strong development foundation (FE, BE, full-stack).**

- I worked as a senior developer and team lead across multiple scopes. This gives me a deep understanding of developer needs, architecture design, and system behavior.

- Ability to code whenever needed — to support, guide, and unblock (not to replace developers).

- I can write code across different languages/frameworks to validate cloud integration, test deployment pipelines, prove concepts, and guide developers with correct cloud-native patterns. Examples include:

  + Implementing password-less authentication with .NET and Azure.

  + Designing authentication/authorization flows using Azure Entra ID or Keycloak.

  + Building queue-driven systems, such as Azure Storage Queue + Function App or Amazon SQS + ECS worker services.

  + Integrating AKS workloads with Application Insights and OpenTelemetry, including instrumenting services, exporting traces/metrics/logs, and validating OTEL collector configs before production.

  + Writing prototypes to test routing rules, API gateway behavior, secrets handling, probes, or autoscaling logic.

  => This helps remove blockers, accelerate research, and ensure deployments and infrastructure work reliably.

**2. Practical Cloud Engineer / Cloud Architect mindset.**

- I guide developers on implementing features that fit cloud-native requirements: stateless design, distributed configuration, health checks, secret management, observability, scaling, and security.

- Hands-on expertise across multiple platforms and languages: Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, .NET, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Golang, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitHub Actions — adaptable to any technical environment.

**B. Developer Support & Team Enablement**

**1. Support developers beyond DevOps responsibilities.**
- I help teams shape implementation so it aligns with deployment, cloud architecture, and operational requirements.

**2. Reduce friction and accelerate delivery.**
- By coding prototypes, testing early, and clarifying cloud expectations, I help avoid delays between dev and cloud teams.

**C. System Design, Architecture & Solution Selection**

**1. End-to-end SDLC awareness.**
- From pre-sales and architecture design to development, CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement, I can see the big picture and guide the team.

**2. System architecture design and solution evaluation.**
- I not only handle infrastructure, deployment, and monitoring but also contribute to selecting the best solutions for system requirements, cost, scalability, and maintainability.

**3. Collaboration with network/security teams.**
- I work closely with these teams to capture requirements, understand constraints, and design systems that are secure, compliant, and operationally feasible.

**4. Fast learning and high adaptability.**
- For migration, DR, new cloud architectures, or new stacks — I research efficiently, prototype, validate, and deliver results quickly.

**D. Leadership, Teamwork & Communication**

**1. Experience as Scrum Master and DevOps Lead.**
- I can identify communication gaps, planning issues, and coordination challenges early, helping the team avoid them.

**2. Strong cross-functional collaboration.**
- I work effectively with developers, QA, architects, product owners, business teams, and cloud teams to ensure reliability, clarity, and productivity.
